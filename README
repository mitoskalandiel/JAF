= Please read the documentation in ./docs/ =
============================================

We offer two forms of documentation for this software :

 * PDF File : This file contains in (hopefully) descriptive
              ways, how to use and interact with the
              Joker Application Framework
 * HTML Files : This form of documentation offers a closer
                look into the inner workings of JAF as well
                as descriptive texts.
                
(To read the html-documentation just point your browser
to your JAF-installation [ie: http://www._your-domain_.com/docs/html/] )
