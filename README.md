## Read Me First

Please read the documentation in ./docs/

### Documentation

We offer two forms of documentation for this software :

 * ~~PDF File : This file contains in (hopefully) descriptive
              ways, how to use and interact with the
              Joker Application Framework~~ (This has been disabled in recent builds as there are issues with the Documentation Generator)
 * HTML Files [^1] : This form of documentation offers a closer
                look into the inner workings of JAF as well
                as descriptive texts.

### Installation
