=== Read Me First ===

Please read the documentation in ./docs/

=== Documentation ===

We offer two forms of documentation for this software :

* <strike>PDF File : This file contains in (hopefully) descriptive
              ways, how to use and interact with the
              Joker Application Framework</strike> (This has been disabled in recent builds as there are issues with the Documentation Generator)
* HTML Files<ref>To read the html-documentation just point your browser to your JAF-installation [ie: ht<span>tp://</span>www.your-domain.com/docs/html/]</ref> : This form of documentation offers a closer
                look into the inner workings of JAF as well
                as descriptive texts.

=== Installation ===

Do a <nowiki>git clone https://github.com/mitoskalandiel/JAF.git</nowiki>
into your webroot (eg: /var/www/html) and visit your browser.
