# Installation #
 ##############

So far installation only involves really one step

Copy the source of JAF into the webroot of your apache
webserver. Point your browser to your-domain.com

Please be aware that following directories always need
write-access (chmod 664) by the web-server :

./themes/_themename_/templates_c/
./themes/_themename_/cache/
(future release : ./db/)

(Please replace "_themename_" with the actual themename, such as "default")
Please note: sometimes you have to change the owner/group of all JAF-files aswell
(chown -R www-user:www-group JAF/)

Any other directory in JAF "only" needs read/exe rights (chmod 554)
